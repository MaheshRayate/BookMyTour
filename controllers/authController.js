/*So up until this point, when we wanted to delete a user, we would simply delete the cookie from our browser. Right? So something like this, and then remove it. However, the thing is that we created this cookie as an http only cookie. Remember that, and so that means that we cannot manipulate this cookie in any way in our browser. So we cannot change it, and we can also not delete it. So let's just quickly take a look at that place in the code where we did that. So in the auth controller up there where we actually create that cookie so that is right here. And so again, remember, that this means that we can not manipulate the cookie in the browser in any way. Not even destroy it. So delete it. So if we want to keep using this super secure way here of storing cookies, then how are we going to be able to actually log out users on our website? Because usually with JWT authentication we just delete the cookie or the token from local storage. But well, again, that's not possible when using it this way. And so what we're gonna do instead is to create a very simple log out route that will simply send back a new cookie with the exact same name but without the token. And so that will then override the current cookie that we have in the browser with one that has the same name but no token. And so when that cookie is then sent along with the next request, then we will not be able to identify the user as being logged in. And so this will effectively then log out the user. And also were gonna give this cookie a very short expiration time. And so this will effectively be a little bit like deleting the cookie but with a very clever workaround like this, okay? */

  /*So a common practice is to send a token using an http header with the request, okay? So let's take a look at how we can set headers in Postman to send him along with the request and then also how we can get access to these headers in Express. And let's actually do that one first. So here in apt.js I think we have this nice middleware here, and so in here let's actually log to the console request.headers, Okay, so we talked about http headers before, and so this is how we can get access to them in Express. Okay, so basically to the request headers, so the ones that a client can send along with their request. Okay, and so here in Postman, let's now actually get to the route that we're actually trying to protect. And then here set a header. And let's just do a test one and set it to jonas, okay? Now I will just send this and here in Express, let's take a look at that. And so indeed here we get an object with all of the headers that are part of the request. So all of this here. And you see that there are a bunch of headers that Postman actually sends automatically along with the request for example, it says the the user-agent is Postman it also sends the host, and some other ones that we're gonna talk about later like accept for example. Now what matters here is actually the header that we set ourselves. Okay, so the test header set to jonas that we just sent in our request. Now to send a JSON web token as a header, there's actually a standard for doing that. So let's go back here, get rid of all of this. And so that standard for sending a token is that we should always use a header called authorization. Okay? So just like this and then the value of that header should always start with Bearer, okay? Because basically we bear, we have, we possess this token and then here the value of the token. So just like this random string that we got before. So let's just leave it her at this as an example, and so let's send that now. */

Basically there are two steps. 
For the first one is that the user sends a post request to a forgot password route, only with this email address. This will then create a reset token and sent that to the email address that was provided. Just a simple, random token, not a JSON Web Token.  Then in the second part, which is gonna be the next video, the user then sends that token from his email along with a new password in order to update his password. Basically, we will have exports dot forgot password which is the first step. So request, response and next and then as a second step, we have reset password.*/

  /*All right and so that is done, but actually what we did was just to modify the data in here in the reatePasswordResetToken . When we set this dot password expires for example to this value, we did in fact not really update the document. We did not save it. We really just modify it, but now we then need to save it. Let's say await user dot save. But watch what happens as we now use this. Let's just grab this one here. This is the route that we did find before. And now we get this route is not yet defined. Let's see why that is. In the user route, we clearly have the same url here, but I see that we actually need to do a post request. All right, okay, but now we get an error saying please provide email and password. And so that's what I meant when I said watch what happens when you try this. That happens because we're trying to save a document, but we do not specify all of the mandatory data, so the fields that we marked as required. Let's quickly fix that. All we need to do is to actually pass a special option into this user dot save method. We say validate before save set to false. This will then deactivate all the validaters that we specified in our schema. It's these small things that you need to know that will make all the difference. Now I also didn't actually know that this existed because no one really knows all of the stuff. It's impossible. A library like Mongoose is simply way too big for you to know everything there is. I went ahead and read the Mongoose documentation and so that's where I found this extremely helpful option. All of this just to say that again, no one knows everything and so it's really a good habit to if you run into some problems to take a look at the documentation for the library that you're using. Let's take a look at this now. And we still get the same error here, but I see down here that it's actually coming from the login function. Let's take a look at what's going on here. Let's take a look at the routes also. Ah, okay, so here's the problem. We are now trying to call the login handler, which of course, doesn't make sense. Here it's forgot password. Here it's reset password. And so the error that we got before was actually not because of the validation. Let's send this again and now we get the error that there is no user with this email address and so that's because we didn't specify any email address in the body. We tested that and so now it's time to actually test it with a user email. All right. And so now it shouldn't actually do anything because we're not sending back any response. Let's just cancel this because all I was really interested in is to see these tokens here and then also to take a look at the user object. This here is the original reset token, so you see it's a random hexadecimal string and then we got the encrypted one in here. This remember is the one that should not be in the database, so ending in a901. Let's take a look at that. And indeed, here it is, password reset token ending in this a901. And also the date, which is in fact 10 minutes from now. */

So, this one is not going to work, and also, these two pre-saved Middlewares are also not going to work.
